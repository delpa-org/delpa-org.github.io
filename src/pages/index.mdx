# The Delpa Project

The Delpa project manages and hosts historical [Melpa][] repository snapshots. A
new snapshot is created roughly twice per month. You can use a pinned version
here instead of directly installing from Melpa, which usually tracks latest
commits from upstream.

## Why Using a Snapshot?

This is useful for two reasons, among other things.

### Less Breakage

Melpa usually tracks the latest commits from upstream, which often causes
breakage. Using a snapshot offers some stability.

### Less Prone to Supply Chain Attack

Configuration frameworks such as [Spacemacs][] and [Doom Emacs][] commonly pull
hundreds of packages from Melpa, depending on the configuration. This poses a
significant [supply chain security
hazard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supply_chain_attack): We become a victim
if any of these hundreds of packages become malicious. This can happen for many
reasons, such as when a maintainer's account is hacked, or a maintainer becomes
malicious ([example](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-cli/issues/7054)).

Thankfully, Melpa packages are open source: Most malicious behaviors can be
found and corrected within a few days, if not hours. By using a snapshot that
has been tested for some days, such as one week or more, we can significantly
reduce the chance of becoming a victim of such a attack.

## Usage

To use a snapshot, pick a version below and add the following to your Emacs
initialization file:

```emacs-lisp
(add-to-list 'package-archives
             '("delpa" . "https://packages.delpa.org/melpa/snapshot/{your version}/") t)
```
