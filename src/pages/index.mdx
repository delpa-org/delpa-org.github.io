import SnapshotVersions from "./_snapshot_versions.mdx";

The Delpa project manages and hosts past [Melpa][] repository snapshots. A new
snapshot is created roughly twice per month. This is helpful for pinning package
versions as Melpa usually tracks latest versions of upstream, which often causes
breakage. If you prefer some stability, you can use a pinned version here
instead of directly installing from Melpa.

## Usage

To use a snapshot, pick a version below and add the following to your Emacs
initialization file:

```emacs-lisp
(add-to-list 'package-archives
             '("delpa" . "https://packages.delpa.org/snapshot/{your version}/") t)
```

### Available Snapshot Versions

<SnapshotVersions />
